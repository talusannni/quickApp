## Running the App

### get your quickApp appId and apiKey from authorised person and also issue a roomID

Before you can run this application by hosting it locally you need to modify `server/vcxconfig.js` there you need to include few mandatory fields like quickApp `appId` and `appKey` , `APPQDN of  your hosting enviorment` , `APPQDN hosting port` , `SSL key and certificate` .
  >Seeting up APPQDN

        > port  : "5454", //APPQDN of  your hosting port
  >setting up SSL credebtials
        
        > ssl_key: " ./../cert/xyz.key", // use the certificate ".key" [self signed or registered]
        > ssl_cert : "./../cert/xyz.crt", // use the certificate ".crt" [self signed or registered]
        > sslCaCerts : [./../cert/xyz.ca-bundle] // use the certificate CA[chain] [self signed or registered]
